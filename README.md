# README

This example application is not meant for production. It demonstrates various data security flaws, and is intended for use with [Curio](https://curio.sh).

We have tried to keep the app somewhat "true to life" and as such you can boot and explore the app if you wish

```
git clone git@github.com:Bearer/bear-publishing.git
cd bear-publishing
bundle
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails db:seed
bundle exec rails s
```
